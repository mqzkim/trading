# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-12)

**Core value:** Every recommendation must be explainable and risk-controlled -- capital preservation and positive expectancy over maximizing returns.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 -- Live Data Pipeline & Korean Data

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 11 (Live Data Pipeline & Korean Data)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Plan 06-01 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-12 -- Completed Plan 06-01 (US Pipeline Fixes & Multi-Market VOs)

Progress: [###░░░░░░░] 27%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 12 (v1.0)
- Average duration: ~5.5 min/plan (v1.0)
- Total execution time: ~1.1 hours (v1.0)

**By Phase (v1.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Data Foundation | 3 | ~16 min | ~5.3 min |
| 2. Analysis Core | 3 | ~17 min | ~5.7 min |
| 3. Decision Engine | 3 | ~16 min | ~5.3 min |
| 4. Execution & Interface | 3 | ~17 min | ~5.7 min |

**By Phase (v1.1):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 5. Tech Debt & Infrastructure | 3/3 | 22 min | 7.3 min |
| 6. Live Data Pipeline & Korean Data | 1/3 | 6 min | 6.0 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.0 retro]: Wire data stores end-to-end before building consumers
- [v1.0 retro]: Add CLI surface incrementally per phase, not at the end
- [v1.0 retro]: Define event contracts early, publish immediately
- [05-01]: SyncEventBus mirrors AsyncEventBus API, fully synchronous for CLI
- [05-01]: bootstrap() eagerly creates all handlers; lazy init deferred to Phase 6+
- [05-01]: Event subscriptions commented in bootstrap.py for Phase 6+ activation
- [05-02]: TakeProfitLevels moved to shared kernel with backward-compat re-export
- [05-02]: AST-based boundary tests for cross-context import enforcement
- [05-02]: ScoreUpdatedEvent stored in result dict (bus publish deferred to Plan 03)
- [05-03]: Lazy bootstrap context via _get_ctx() -- bootstrap() called once on first handler-using command
- [05-03]: Event bus wired with minimal logging handler (no side effects) per RESEARCH pitfall 3
- [05-03]: Core/ commands (regime, score, signal, analyze) keep existing imports; full DDD migration deferred to Phase 6+
- [06-01]: Ticker regex [A-Z0-9]{1,10} for both US and Korean tickers
- [06-01]: QualityChecker uses numpy.busday_count for business-day staleness
- [06-01]: Symbol VO isupper() or isdigit() for multi-market validation

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

Carried forward from v1.0:
- ~~yfinance adjusted close behavior -- needs empirical validation (Phase 6)~~ RESOLVED in 06-01 (DATA-01)
- ~~edgartools XBRL coverage for smaller companies -- test against sample (Phase 6)~~ RESOLVED in 06-01 (DATA-02)
- Alpaca paper trading does NOT simulate dividends -- separate tracking needed
- python-kis KIS developer registration -- may require Korean brokerage account (Phase 10)
- pykrx KOSDAQ small-cap fundamental coverage -- validate empirically (Phase 6)
