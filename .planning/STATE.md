## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.3 research]: Next.js 16 + TradingView Lightweight Charts + TanStack Query + Zustand + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4
- [v1.3 research]: Next.js acts as BFF proxy to FastAPI via next.config.ts rewrites (never direct DB access)
- [v1.3 research]: SSE proxied through next.config.ts rewrites (not Next.js Route Handlers) to avoid buffering
- [v1.3 research]: Biome 2.x replaces ESLint + Prettier (Next.js 16 removed next lint)
- [v1.3 research]: Server Components for static layout, Client Components for dynamic data

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

Carried forward:
- Alpaca paper trading does NOT simulate dividends -- separate tracking needed
- python-kis KIS developer registration -- may require Korean brokerage account

New for v1.3:
- TradingView chart memory leaks -- must call chart.remove() in useLayoutEffect cleanup
- SSE buffering through Next.js -- use next.config.ts rewrites, not Route Handlers
- React Compiler (Next.js 16) may conflict with TradingView useRef patterns -- verify in Phase 22
