# Phase 3 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | pytest 7.x |
| **Config file** | pyproject.toml |
| **Quick run command** | `pytest tests/ -x --tb=short` |
| **Full suite command** | `pytest tests/ -v` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~30 seconds |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `pytest tests/ -x --tb=short`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `pytest tests/ -v`
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Max feedback latency:** 30 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

*Note: This table will be populated after plans are created.*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] Test stubs for signal generation (SIGN-01, SIGN-02)
- [ ] Test stubs for risk management (RISK-01 through RISK-05)
- [ ] Test stubs for backtesting (BACK-01, BACK-02)
- [ ] Shared fixtures for scoring data, portfolio state

*Existing test infrastructure from Phase 1-2 covers framework setup.*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Reasoning trace readability | SIGN-01 | Human judgment on explanation quality | Review 3+ signal outputs for clarity |

*All other phase behaviors have automated verification.*

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < 30s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
